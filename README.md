# Personal Activity and Fitness Analysis Project Proposal

## Project Overview  
This project explores the relationship between my fitness habits and personal hobbies, aiming to uncover patterns and correlations. Specifically, it investigates how time spent watching movies/TV series and playing chess may influence gym attendance.  

The motivation for this study arises from a common perception that hobbies, such as watching TV or playing games, often act as excuses for skipping the gym. By analyzing personal data, I aim to gain insights into my time management and activity balance over the past year.

- **Zepp Life and Mi Fitness Apps**: Hours spent at the gym.  
- **TV Time App**: Hours spent watching movies and series.  

### Key Features:  
- Weekly aggregated data to ensure consistency across all sources.  
- Time-based patterns of engagement for each activity.
