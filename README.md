# Personal Activity and Fitness Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between my fitness habits and personal hobbies, specifically focusing on the influence of time spent watching movies/TV series on gym attendance. The motivation for this study arises from the common perception that hobbies such as watching TV may serve as excuses for skipping gym sessions. By analyzing personal data, this project aims to uncover patterns and correlations between these activities over the past year.

## Dataset

The analysis uses approximately one year of data from the following sources:

- **Zepp Life and Mi Fitness Apps**: Tracks hours spent at the gym.
- **TV Time App**: Tracks hours spent watching movies and TV series.

### Key Features:
- Weekly aggregated data to ensure consistency across all sources.
- Time-based patterns of engagement for each activity.

## Objectives

1. **Understand Trends**:
   - Analyze weekly patterns in gym attendance and TV watching.

2. **Identify Correlations**:
   - Investigate whether time spent watching TV impacts gym attendance.

3. **Gain Insights**:
   - Determine if TV watching acts as a genuine time conflict or perceived excuse for skipping gym sessions.

## Tools

- **Pandas**: For data preprocessing and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and statistical calculations.

## Project Plan

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
   - Export and clean data from Zepp Life, Mi Fitness, and TV Time.
   - Aggregate data on a weekly basis to align datasets.

### 2. Data Analysis:
   - Calculate weekly averages for gym hours and TV watching.
   - Analyze trends in each activity over time.
   - Identify potential correlations between gym hours and TV watching.

### 3. Visualization:
   - Develop graphs to illustrate weekly trends for gym and TV activity.
   - Highlight significant patterns or outliers.

### 4. Reporting:
   - Summarize findings and insights in a structured report.
   - Discuss possible reasons behind the observed correlations (or lack thereof).

## Conclusion

This project serves as a self-reflective tool to better understand my habits and make data-driven decisions for a balanced lifestyle. By uncovering the dynamics between fitness and TV watching, the project aims to optimize time management and promote healthier living.
