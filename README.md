Personal Activity and Fitness Analysis Project Proposal
Motivation
While considering project ideas, I decided to explore how I manage my time across different activities, particularly hobbies and fitness. A common claim is that people often skip the gym because of a lack of time, blaming hobbies like watching TV or playing games. Through this project, I aim to analyze whether my time spent watching movies/series or playing chess has any significant impact on my gym activity.

This project will help me better understand my habits and the relationship between these activities.

Tools
Pandas: For processing and structuring the data.
Numpy: For numerical operations.

Data Sources

Chess.com Data:
My Elo rating and games played, along with timestamps.

Zepp Life and Mi Fitness Apps:
Data on hours spent at the gym.

TV Time App:
Hours spent watching movies and series.
These datasets represent my activities over approximately one year and will be processed to align for comparison (e.g., by weekly aggregation).

Objectives
Understand trends: Analyze weekly patterns in gym activity, chess playing, and TV watching.
Identify correlations: Check if time spent on hobbies (chess or watching TV) affects gym attendance.
Gain insights: Determine whether hobbies serve as excuses for skipping gym sessions.
