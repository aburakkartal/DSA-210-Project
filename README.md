Personal Activity and Fitness Analysis Project Proposal
Project Overview
This project investigates the relationship between my fitness habits and personal hobbies, aiming to identify patterns and correlations between these activities. Specifically, I will analyze how time spent watching movies/TV series and playing chess might impact my gym attendance.

The motivation stems from a common perception that hobbies, such as watching TV or playing games, often serve as excuses for skipping the gym. By analyzing my data, I hope to gain insights into my time management and activity balance over the past year.

Dataset
The project utilizes three primary data sources, covering approximately one year of activity:

Chess.com: Elo ratings, games played, and timestamps.
Zepp Life and Mi Fitness Apps: Hours spent at the gym.
TV Time App: Hours spent watching movies and series.
Key features include:

Weekly aggregated data for consistency across sources.
Time-based patterns of engagement in each activity.
Objectives
Understand Trends:

Analyze weekly patterns in gym attendance, chess activity, and TV watching.
Identify Correlations:

Investigate whether time spent on hobbies (chess or TV) affects gym activity.
Gain Insights:

Determine if hobbies act as genuine time conflicts or perceived excuses for skipping gym sessions.
Tools
Pandas: For data preprocessing and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and statistical calculations.
Project Plan
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Export and clean data from Chess.com, Zepp Life, Mi Fitness, and TV Time.
Aggregate data on a weekly basis to align datasets.
Data Analysis:

Calculate weekly averages for gym hours, TV watching, and chess activity.
Analyze trends in each activity over time.
Identify potential correlations between gym hours and hobbies.
Visualization:

Develop graphs to illustrate weekly trends for gym, chess, and TV activity.
Highlight significant patterns or outliers.
Reporting:

Summarize findings and insights in a structured report.
Discuss possible reasons behind the observed correlations.
This project is an opportunity to better understand my habits and make data-driven decisions for a balanced lifestyle.
